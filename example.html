        <h1 style="background-color: pink; color: white ;"><strong>Bard vs ChatGPT: Which is better for coding?</strong></h1><br><br>
        <p>June 06, 2023</p>
        <p>For programmers, Generative AI offers tangible benefits. It helps with writing and debugging code, making our busy lives a bit easier as a result. But there are now competing tools like ChatGPT and Bard, which begs the question: which one is best for me to use?<br><br>

            We compare these tools against each other in the ultimate battle to see which is the most feature-rich tool right now for programming purposes.</p>
            <h1><b>Bard vs ChatGPT: What’s the difference?</b></h1>
            <p>The biggest difference between ChatGPT and Bard is the Large Language Models (LLMs) they are powered by. ChatGPT uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), while Bard uses the Language Model for Dialogue Applications <b>(LaMBDA)</b>. Also, ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI, while Bard was built by Google.

                In terms of capabilities, both do very similar things. Programmers can use ChatGPT for:</p>
                <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> Both models can suggest the correct syntax and parameters for functions and other code constructs.
                    <br><br>

                   <strong> Completion:</strong> It can complete code that you have started writing.
                   <br><br>
                    <strong>Debugging:</strong> It can help you identify errors and problems in your code.
                    <br><br>
                    
                   <strong> Explanation:</strong> It can explain the code that it generates, or code you input.</p>
                   <p>Both models were trained on a massive dataset, including Common Crawl, Wikipedia, books, articles, documents, and content scraped from the internet. However, Bard is a little different in that it was trained on conversations and dialogues from the web, while ChatGPT was trained mostly on scraped general content.

                    Both products are still under development, Bard a bit more so than ChatGPT. But to really show how these differences actually matter in a practical sense, here’s how they work when tested against each other.</p>
